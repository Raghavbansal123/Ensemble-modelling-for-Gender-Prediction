# Ensemble-modelling-for-Gender-Prediction
## Gender Prediction is classification problem. A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue”.
## Ensemble models in machine learning operate on a similar idea. They combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance.
## Steps:-
1)  Exploratory data analysis (with visualization) and Data Cleaning if required
2) Questions asked on dataset and answers for the same with brief explanation  
3) Feature Selection and feature Engineering
4) Ensemble Machine learning Modelling (3 Classification Algorithms)
5) Accuracy calculation
